Operating System update policy
================

Security update policy for Android
---------------

Coppernic combines the latest security patch and submits for approval to Google twice a year.
These updates are correlated with update given by Google to [aosp project](https://source.android.com/). They
are considered as *Major Release*.
In the meantime, Coppernic can provide intermediary version with bug fixes if need be.

There are two kinds of updates:

 - **Classical**: A [factory reset](factory_reset.md) is performed during update process. All custom data are lost and a full reinstall is needed.
 - **OTA**: This is a differential update that can be performed between *Major Release* OS. This method is available
 under specific conditions. Please contact our [support center](https://support.coppernic.fr/index.php) for more information.
