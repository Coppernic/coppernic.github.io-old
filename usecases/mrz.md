# MRZ Read

On devices that do not embed physical MRZ reader, camera and an external SDK can be used
to achieve MRZ recognition.

Coppernic works with Regula Forensics to read MRZ lines on passport. We have
successfully embedded Regula's SDK into applications running on Coppernic's devices.

You can contact our [Support center](https://support.coppernic.fr/index.php)
to ask for a trial license. We will need following information :

- [AppID/BundleID](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/application-id) of your application
- What type of ID you need to scan (Passport, ID cards, etc.)
- IDs issuing states/countries
- Number of scans or app users expected per year?

You can start by reading Regula's [documentation](https://docs.regulaforensics.com/home/)
