System Applications
-------------------

OS signature keys are private to Coppernic and are given to nobody. No exceptions.

If you want to develop system applications, then you need to send your application to our [support center](http://support.coppernic.fr) for signature.

Kiosk applications
------------------

We can give some pieces of advice to choose the kiok application that's right for you. We do not have our own product.

Application update
------------------

There are several ways to keep your applications up to date on your Coppernic devices

- **ADB** : Very handful at development stage. This tool from google allows you to do many things with your device. https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb

- [F-Droid](fdroid.md) : Your application can be deployed on F-Droid and available on all your devices for an update

- **EMM** : You can deploy your app wit an EMM such as MobiControl.

Both F-Droid and MobiControl can updat your application even when device is kiosked.
